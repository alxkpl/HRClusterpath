  - title: Matrices computation
    desc: |
      Functions which can be used to extract/give the block model structure to 
      a matrix with a given clustering, and other tools...
    contents: 
      - extract_R_matrix
      - ChiToGamma
      - build_theta

  - title: Likelihood functions
    desc: |
      Computation of the likelihood function for a HÃ¼sler-Reiss graphical model, 
      as well ass the penalised version of the latter.
    contents:
      - neg_likelihood

  - title: Optimization
    desc: |
      We give two way for the optimization : the one studied with exponential
      weights ans a softer one with customizable weights.
